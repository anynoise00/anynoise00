## Hello, my name is VinÃ­cius - a full-stack web developer
### Welcome to my profile! ðŸ˜ƒ

ðŸŒ± Became a full-stack web developer at [TripleTen](https://tripleten.com/pt-bra/web/meet/)'s online web development bootcamp  
ðŸ“š I have a technical degree in IT, with an emphasis on web development  
ðŸ’¬ Intemediate english knowledge and native portuguese speaker  

I started learning how to code some years ago, when I did a game development course through Udemy. Since then I've been honing my problem solving skills, and now I'm applying then to web development.
